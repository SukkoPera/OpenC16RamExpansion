### Summary
The board fits the cartridge/expansion port and instantly gives 64 kilobytes of RAM to a C16, giving it the ability of running many games that were originally targeted at the Plus/4.

There were [several similar expansions](http://plus4world.powweb.com/hardware) back in the day, but I have never seen one in real life. Thus, I designed this board only by looking at [various C16/Plus/4 schematics](http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/computers/plus4/index.html) and images (mostly low-resolution) of similar boards I found on the Net, which I have included in the [doc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SukkoPera/OpenC16RamExpansion/master/doc/) directory.
